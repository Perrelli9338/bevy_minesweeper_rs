# Minesweeper made with Bevy
Yet another project of the classic Minesweeper game, but! It's made with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/it), using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine. 
# Features
- Customizable width, height and bombs size
- Safe start mode: Select an empty tile when the game start
- Simple user interface
# Platforms
It should work well on all platforms, but the UI is not yet adapted, so it may be difficult to use on a small screen.
# How to play on mobile
Gestures:
- Tap to uncover a tile
- Tap with two fingers to add a flag
