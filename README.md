Yet another project of the classic Minesweeper game, but! It's made with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/it), using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine.
# Features
- Customizable width, height and numbers of bombs
- Safe Start mode: Select an empty tile when starting the game
- Track your time with the stopwatch
- Simple user interface
# Platforms
[Click here](https://github.com/Perrelli9338/bevy_minesweeper_rs/releases/latest) for the latest version of the supported platform. \
It should work fine, but the user interface has not yet been adapted, so it may be difficult to use on a small screen.
# How to play on mobile
Gestures:
- Tap to uncover a tile
- Tap with two fingers to add a flag
